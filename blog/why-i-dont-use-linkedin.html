			<h3>Why I Don't Use LinkedIn</h3>
			<p>
				First and foremost, let me disclose that this post is not an affront to those who enjoy using LinkedIn and find it to be a useful tool.
				This is merely a loose account of my experience using LinkedIn and the reasoning behind my decision to stop using the platform.
			</p>
			<p>
				As of today, the meta description for linkedin.com reads: "Manage your professional identity.
				Build and engage with your professional network.
				Access knowledge, insights and opportunities".
				This implies that LinkedIn was created to be a tool for managing and interacting with one's professional network and for managing one's professional profile.
				In my experience, LinkedIn is ineffective for the former and mediocre for the latter.
			</p>
			<p>
				Upon creating my LinkedIn account, I immediately began searching for people I knew from school and adding them to my network.
				Following the prompts displayed on-screen, I also followed some interesting-looking companies.
				Checking my feed, I was disappointed to find it filled with links to uninspiring articles that likely served as advertising for the companies that posted them.
				I continued to follow more companies and add more people to my network in a desperate attempt to populate my feed with interesting content.
				Before I knew it, I had hundreds of "connections", many of whom I had never met nor had any plans of meeting or otherwise interacting with in the future.
				The few attempts I made to promote discussion by sending messages or commenting on a post were met with blank stares, or more accurately, the digital equivalent: no response.
				People were keen on communicating using overly formal language in a way that did not invite meaningful discussion.
				The comments that people wrote would often be generic positive feedback carrying the same weight as a simple thumbs-up.
			</p>
			<p>
				There was no hope left.
				I stopped checking the site for weeks at a time, only occasionally logging in to mindlessly "connect" with strangers, hoping that these connections would somehow benefit me in the future.
				I suppose that LinkedIn does have some merit as a tool for keeping track of what other people are doing, as evidenced by the myriad of posts that I've seen from peers who have taken on new roles upon graduating from college.
				In general, I am not concerned with the professional affairs of people other than myself, so this aspect is also meaningless.
				The root of the problem is that there is no real passion on display: the only passion that people on LinkedIn seem to have is a passion for being a suit-wearing professional and spouting smart-sounding remarks about mundane topics.
				LinkedIn is too formal, and because of this, it has no personality.
			</p>
			<p>
				Many people simply use LinkedIn as a kind of digital resume and don't bother trying to acquire knowledge and insight from the platform.
				For a while, this is what I did until I remembered that I was a developer and that I was fully capable of building a personal website from scratch; this is exactly what I did.
				From my experiences so far, I can say that those who wish to have greater control over the design and presentation of their profile would be much better off creating a personal website, even if it is based on an existing WordPress or Squarespace theme.
				But for people who would rather not go through the trouble, LinkedIn is a decent alternative.
			</p>
			<p>
				I deleted my LinkedIn account a couple of weeks ago and I have not looked back.
				I see that many developers seem to use Twitter as a less formal version of LinkedIn that is not devoid of humor and thought-provoking content; this looks very promising.
