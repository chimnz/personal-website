				<p>
					My name is Christian Chimezie [chim-easy].
					I am a programmer and technology enthusiast who
					has recently graduated from college,
					and I am actively seeking employment.
					There is nothing that I enjoy more than writing
					elegant and scalable code to solve complex problems,
					so this is the direction I will proceed in career-wise.
					In the upcoming months, I hope to continue improving my
					skills as a developer while also making plenty of
					contributions to open-source.
					Feel free to <a href='mailto:chris.chimezie@gmail.com'>
					shoot me an email</a> if there is anything you would
					like to discuss.
