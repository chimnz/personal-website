			<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
			<p>
				My name is Christian Chimezie [chim-easy].
				I am a new grad with a scientific bent and
				plenty of programming experience,
				and I am currently seeking new opportunities.
				There are few things that I enjoy more than coding
				elegant and efficient solutions to interesting problems,
				so this is the direction that I will proceed in career-wise.
				In the meantime, I will continue to increase the
				breadth and depth of my knowledge of computer science
				while honing my problem-solving skills. 
				Feel free to <a href='mailto:chris.chimezie@gmail.com'>
				shoot me an email</a> if there is anything you would
				like to discuss.
