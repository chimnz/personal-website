			<h3>Who am I?</h3>
			<p>
				My name is Christian Chimezie [chim-easy].
				I am a programmer and technology enthusiast who
				has recently graduated from college,
				and I am actively seeking employment.
				There is nothing that I enjoy more than writing
				elegant and scalable code to solve complex problems,
				so this is the direction I will proceed in career-wise.
				In the upcoming months, I hope to continue improving my
				skills as a developer while also making plenty of
				contributions to open-source.
				Feel free to <a href='mailto:chris.chimezie@gmail.com'>
				shoot me an email</a> if there is anything you would
				like to discuss.
